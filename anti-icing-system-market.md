<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-icing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Anti-icing System market consists of two main types: Type I and Type II. Type I systems are designed for use on aircraft that operate at slower speeds and lower altitudes. These systems typically use a heated fluid, such as a glycol-water mixture, to prevent ice formation on critical surfaces. Type II systems, on the other hand, are more commonly used on larger aircraft operating at higher speeds and altitudes. They utilize inflatable boots or mechanical devices to physically break and shed ice from the aircraft surfaces.</p></p>
