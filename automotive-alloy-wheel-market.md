<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Alloy Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive alloy wheel market can be categorized into three types: casting, forging, and other market. Casting involves the pouring of molten alloy into a mold and allowing it to solidify, resulting in a wheel with good aesthetic appeal but slightly lower strength. Forging is a process where alloy is compressed and shaped using high-pressure machinery, producing stronger and lighter wheels but with a higher cost. The "other market" encompasses various wheel manufacturing methods like spinning and flow forming, each offering their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of strength, weight, and cost.</p></p>
