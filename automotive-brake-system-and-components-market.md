<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake System and Components Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brake</li><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive brake system and components market can be categorized into three types: disc brake, drum brake, and others. Disc brakes utilize a pair of brake pads to clamp down on a disc rotor, converting the kinetic energy of the vehicle into thermal energy. Drum brakes, on the other hand, employ brake shoes that press against a rotating drum to achieve the same effect. The "others" category comprises alternative brake systems, such as regenerative brakes or electric brakes, which are increasingly being used in electric and hybrid vehicles.</p></p>
