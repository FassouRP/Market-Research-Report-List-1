<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brown Fused Aluminium Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dumping Furnace Type</li><li>Fixed Furnace Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Brown Fused Aluminium Oxide (BFAO) is available in two types in the market: Dumping Furnace Type and Fixed Furnace Type. Dumping Furnace Type BFAO is produced by dumping raw materials into a furnace and allowing them to melt and solidify. This process results in a varied grain size distribution and lower purity. In contrast, Fixed Furnace Type BFAO is produced by controlling the furnace temperature and maintaining a specific environment. This process ensures a consistent grain size distribution and higher purity.</p></p>
