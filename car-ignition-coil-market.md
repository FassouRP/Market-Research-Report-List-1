<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Ignition Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Spark</li><li>Multi-Spark</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car ignition coil market is divided into two types: single-spark and multi-spark. Single-spark ignition coils produce a single spark at the spark plug, resulting in one ignition event per cycle. On the other hand, multi-spark ignition coils are designed to produce multiple sparks at the spark plug, creating multiple ignition events within one cycle. While single-spark ignition coils are simpler and more cost-effective, multi-spark coils offer better fuel efficiency, smoother engine operation, and reduced emissions.</p></p>
