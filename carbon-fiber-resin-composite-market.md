<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber-Resin Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Type</li><li>Thermoplastic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carbon fiber-resin composite market consists of two main types: thermosetting and thermoplastic. Thermosetting composites are formed by mixing carbon fibers with a resin that undergoes a chemical reaction when cured, resulting in a rigid and strong material that cannot be reshaped. On the other hand, thermoplastic composites are made using a resin that can be melted and reformed multiple times without losing its properties, providing flexibility and ease of processing. Both types have their own advantages and applications, catering to different industry needs.</p></p>
