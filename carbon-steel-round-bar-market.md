<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Steel Round Bar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Carbon Steel</li><li>High Carbon Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon steel round bars can be classified into two types: low carbon steel and high carbon steel. Low carbon steel round bars have a lower amount of carbon content, typically less than 0.30%, making them more malleable and weldable. They are commonly used in applications where ductility and ease of machining are essential. High carbon steel round bars, on the other hand, have a higher carbon content, usually between 0.60% and 1.00%. This makes them stronger and harder, suitable for applications requiring increased strength, wear resistance, and hardness.</p></p>
