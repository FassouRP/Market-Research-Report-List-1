<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Ply</li><li>Radial Ply</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Construction tyres are classified into two types: bias ply tyres and radial ply tyres. Bias ply tyres are constructed with multiple layers of fabric cords crisscrossed at angles to provide strength and stability. They are known for their durability and resistance to cuts and impacts. Radial ply tyres, on the other hand, have layers of cords running perpendicular to the direction of travel, which allows for better traction and fuel efficiency. They are popular for their enhanced safety, smoother ride, and longer lifespan. Both types of tyres serve different purposes and cater to specific construction applications.</p></p>
