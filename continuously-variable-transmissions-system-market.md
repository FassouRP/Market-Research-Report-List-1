<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuously Variable Transmissions System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Belt</li><li>Metal Chain</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) are a type of transmission system that allows for seamless and stepless gear ratio changes. In the market, CVTs are available in two main types: Metal Belt and Metal Chain. Metal Belt CVTs use two pulleys connected by a metal belt to vary the ratio, while Metal Chain CVTs use a metal chain with many links to achieve the same effect. Both types offer excellent fuel efficiency and smooth acceleration, but Metal Belt CVTs tend to be more common in passenger vehicles, while Metal Chain CVTs are often found in heavier-duty applications.</p></p>
