<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disk Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opposed Piston Type</li><li>Floating Caliper Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The disk brakes market consists of two major types: Opposed Piston Type and Floating Caliper Type. In the Opposed Piston Type, each side of the brake disk is pressed by pistons located on opposite sides of the brake caliper. This design ensures even distribution of braking force and provides high braking performance. On the other hand, the Floating Caliper Type uses a single piston that pushes against one side of the brake rotor, allowing it to slide within the caliper. This type is cost-effective and easy to maintain, offering good braking performance.</p></p>
