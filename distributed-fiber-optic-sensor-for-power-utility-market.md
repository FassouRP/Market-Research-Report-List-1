<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Fiber Optic Sensor for Power & Utility Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multimode</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The power and utility market commonly employs two types of distributed fiber optic sensors: single-mode and multimode. Single-mode optical fibers have a small core, allowing only one mode of light to propagate through them, resulting in a highly focused and narrower beam. These fibers are suitable for long-distance applications and offer high data capacity. On the other hand, multimode optical fibers have a larger core, enabling multiple modes of light to travel simultaneously. This makes them more suitable for short-distance applications like local area networks.</p></p>
