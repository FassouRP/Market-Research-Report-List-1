<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Edible Grade Gelatin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Hydrolysis</li><li>Alkaline Hydrolysis</li><li>Enzyme Preparation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The edible grade gelatin market is classified into three types based on the production process: acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis, and enzyme preparation. In acid hydrolysis, gelatin is produced by subjecting collagen to an acidic environment, resulting in the breaking down of collagen into gelatin. Alkaline hydrolysis involves the use of an alkaline substance to achieve the same result. Enzyme preparation, on the other hand, utilizes specific enzymes to hydrolyze collagen and convert it into gelatin. These different production methods offer various characteristics and applications for the gelatin in the market.</p></p>
