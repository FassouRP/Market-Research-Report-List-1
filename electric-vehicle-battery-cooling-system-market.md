<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Battery Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooling System</li><li>Liquid Cooling System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric vehicle battery cooling system market consists of two types: air cooling system and liquid cooling system. An air cooling system uses fans to circulate air around the battery cells, dissipating the heat generated during operation. On the other hand, a liquid cooling system circulates coolant or refrigerant through channels embedded in the battery pack, absorbing the heat and transferring it away. Both types aim to maintain optimal operating temperatures for the battery, ensuring its efficiency and longevity.</p></p>
