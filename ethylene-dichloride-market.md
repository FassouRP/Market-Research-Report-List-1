<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethylene Dichloride Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Chlorination</li><li>Oxychlorination</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ethylene Dichloride (EDC) is produced through two main processes: direct chlorination and oxychlorination. In the direct chlorination process, ethylene gas is reacted with chlorine gas in the presence of a catalyst, resulting in EDC formation. Oxychlorination, on the other hand, involves the use of oxygen in addition to the catalyst. Both methods produce EDC, which is commonly used as a solvent or chemical intermediate in various industries such as plastics, textiles, and agriculture. The choice between direct chlorination and oxychlorination depends on factors like cost, efficiency, and environmental considerations.</p></p>
