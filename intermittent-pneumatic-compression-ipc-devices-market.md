<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</li><li>Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) devices are medical devices used to prevent and treat conditions like Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). DVT refers to the formation of blood clots in deep veins, typically in the leg, which may cause pain and swelling. PE occurs when these blood clots travel to the lungs, potentially leading to blocked blood vessels. The IPC devices provide compression to the affected areas, promoting blood flow and reducing the risk of clot formation or assisting in their dissolution, thus aiding in the prevention and treatment of DVT and PE.</p></p>
