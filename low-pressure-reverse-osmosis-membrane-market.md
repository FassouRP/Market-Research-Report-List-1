<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Composite Membranes</li><li>Asymmetric Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis (RO) Membrane market consists of two main types: Composite Membranes and Asymmetric Membranes. Composite Membranes are constructed with multiple layers, typically consisting of a thin polyamide layer on top of a porous support layer. This design allows for high rejection rates and good water flux. Asymmetric Membranes, on the other hand, have a single dense layer that acts as a barrier to impurities. These membranes offer high removal efficiency and are often used in applications where fouling may occur.</p></p>
