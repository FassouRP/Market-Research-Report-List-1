<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Contact Radar Level Transmitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Guided-Wave Radar Level Transmitter</li><li>Non-Contact Wave Radar Level Transmitter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The non-contact radar level transmitter market encompasses two main types: guided-wave radar level transmitters and non-contact wave radar level transmitters. Guided-wave radar transmitters use a probe that extends into the liquid or solid material being measured and emits radar waves, using the probe as a waveguide. Non-contact wave radar transmitters, on the other hand, emit radar waves from above the material, without the need for a probe. Both types provide accurate level measurement in various industrial applications, but vary in terms of installation and measurement range.</p></p>
