<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Scavengers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metallic Oxygen Scavengers</li><li>Non-metallic Oxygen Scavengers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxygen scavengers are substances used to remove or reduce the amount of oxygen in a system. The market for oxygen scavengers is classified into two types: metallic oxygen scavengers and non-metallic oxygen scavengers. Metallic oxygen scavengers mainly include iron-based components that react with oxygen to form oxides, preventing the presence of oxygen in the system. Non-metallic oxygen scavengers, on the other hand, are usually organic compounds that undergo reactions, such as oxidation or reduction, to eliminate oxygen. Both types are widely used in various industries to preserve the quality and extend the shelf life of products.</p></p>
