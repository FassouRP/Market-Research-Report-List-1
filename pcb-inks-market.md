<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Inks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Cure</li><li>UV Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCB (Printed Circuit Board) Inks market is categorized into two types: Thermal Cure and UV Cure. Thermal Cure inks are cured by applying heat. They require a specific temperature to cure properly and form a solid layer on the PCB surface. On the other hand, UV Cure inks are cured by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. When exposed to UV light, these inks undergo a chemical reaction that results in quick and efficient curing, forming a hardened layer on the PCB. Both types of inks offer different curing methods for PCB manufacturing.</p></p>
