<p><h1>Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices Market Size and Growth, Market Segmentation, Regional and Country Breakdowns, and Market Trends for Period from 2023 -  2030</h1></p><p><strong>Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Peripheral intervention drug-eluting devices are medical devices that are used in the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a condition where there is a narrowing or blockage of blood vessels outside of the heart, usually affecting the arteries that supply blood to the legs. These devices deliver medication directly to the affected blood vessel, preventing the formation of new blockages and reducing the risk of restenosis, which is the re-narrowing of the blood vessel after treatment.</p><p>The market analysis of peripheral intervention drug-eluting devices suggests that the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of PAD, rising geriatric population, and advancements in drug delivery technologies. Additionally, the growing adoption of minimally invasive procedures and the increasing focus on improving patient outcomes are also driving the market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the peripheral intervention drug-eluting devices market is the development of bioresorbable drug-eluting devices. These devices are designed to dissolve over time, eliminating the need for long-term implantation and reducing the risk of complications. This trend is driven by the demand for safer and more patient-friendly treatment options.</p><p>Another trend in the market is the introduction of next-generation drug-eluting devices that offer improved drug delivery capabilities. These devices are designed to deliver drugs more effectively and consistently to the targeted site, ensuring better treatment outcomes. The development of innovative drug-eluting agents, such as anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory drugs, is also contributing to the growth of the market.</p><p>In conclusion, the peripheral intervention drug-eluting devices market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. The market will be driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of PAD, advancements in drug delivery technologies, and the introduction of innovative treatment options. The development of bioresorbable devices and next-generation drug-eluting devices are some of the latest trends in the market.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drug-Eluting Balloons</li><li>Drug-Eluting Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices are medical devices used in the treatment of peripheral artery disease. Drug-Eluting Balloons are inflated in the narrowed artery and deliver medication to prevent re-blockage. Meanwhile, Drug-Eluting Stents are metallic scaffolds placed in the artery, delivering drugs to inhibit re-blockage and keep the artery open. These devices provide targeted drug delivery, allowing for more effective and long-lasting treatment outcomes. They offer a minimally invasive alternative to surgical procedures, reducing the risks associated with complications and improving patient recovery.</p></p>
