<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radical Initiator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Molecules</li><li>Azo Compounds</li><li>Peroxides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radical initiators play a crucial role in many chemical reactions, particularly in polymerization processes. There are three main types of radical initiators on the market: halogen molecules, azo compounds, and peroxides. Halogen molecules, such as chlorine and bromine, are highly reactive and often used in organic synthesis. Azo compounds, like AIBN, release nitrogen radicals upon thermal decomposition, initiating reactions. Peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxide, generate radicals via homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond. These initiators are essential in various industries, including plastics, coatings, and adhesives.</p></p>
