<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specialty Inorganic Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heterogeneous</li><li>Homogenous</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Specialty inorganic catalysts are used extensively in various industrial processes. Heterogeneous catalysts are solid substances that are in a different phase as the reactants, allowing for efficient reactions due to their large surface area and easily separable nature. On the other hand, homogeneous catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants, usually as a liquid solution, enabling a more even distribution and control of reactants. Both types play a crucial role in catalyzing chemical reactions, depending on the specific requirements of the process, such as selectivity and reaction conditions.</p></p>
