<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Welded Steel Pipe</li><li>Seamless Steel Pipe</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The steel pipe market comprises two main types: welded steel pipe and seamless steel pipe. Welded steel pipes are manufactured by joining steel plates or coils through welding, resulting in a sturdy and cost-effective product suitable for various applications. On the other hand, seamless steel pipes are made by piercing a solid steel billet to form a hollow tube without any welding. This process creates pipes with superior strength and resistance, preferable for high-pressure and temperature environments. Both types cater to different needs and industries within the vast steel pipe market.</p></p>
