<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cells Cryopreservation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Stem Cells Cryopreservation Equipment Market consists of two types: Liquid Phase and Vapor Phase. In Liquid Phase, the stem cells are stored in a reservoir containing a liquid cryoprotectant at a very low temperature (-196Â°C). This prevents the cells from freezing and damaging their structure. On the other hand, in Vapor Phase, the cells are stored in an environment where liquid nitrogen is used to create a vaporized form of the cryoprotectant. This method eliminates the risk of cross-contamination and provides a safer storage environment for the stem cells.</p></p>
