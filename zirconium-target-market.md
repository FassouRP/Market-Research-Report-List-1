<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zirconium Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Planar Target</li><li>Rotating Target</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The zirconium target market can be divided into two types: planar target and rotating target. Planar target refers to the use of a flat substrate made of zirconium, where the target material is deposited onto the surface. This type is commonly used for thin film coating applications. On the other hand, rotating target involves spinning a cylindrical zirconium target during the deposition process, allowing for a more uniform coating and higher production rates. Rotating targets find extensive usage in industries requiring thicker zirconium layers or enhanced efficiency.</p></p>
